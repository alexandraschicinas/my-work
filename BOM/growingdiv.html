      // this currently does not work :(, as an ideea try and move the condition outside the interval function
      // and clear the interval once that condition is met.
      // to speed testing the solution instead of adding with 5 add with 200
      // also please try and use let instead of var
      
        // instead of checking with 1500 we could check with window.innerWidth to work with any resolution
