            <h1>Chia pudding</h1>
            <p> Chia Pudding is made with almond milk, chia seeds & sweetener of choice; it's a healthy snack loaded with protein, fiber and healthy fats!
            I want you to add one more healthy, easy and filling snack to that line-up: chia pudding! I make my chia pudding with only 3 ingredients: chia seeds, milk and a sweetener of choice. When it settles in the fridge, it has a pudding texture, amazing flavor and lends itself to endless topping possibilities. It’s a snack will leave you feeling satisfied, satiated and so energized for your day!</p>
             <p> Start with two mason jars of almond milk (or any milk you’d like), some chia seeds and honey (or any other sweetener you’d like). You can also leave out the sweetener if you prefer to sweeten it only with toppings like fresh fruit, dried fruit or chocolate chips.</p>
             <p> The ratio is everything! There are different recommendations for the best chia pudding ratio out there. I’ve made this 100 times and in the end, the ratio I found that works best is 1 tablespoon chia seeds to 1/4 cup of milk. To make it into a complete snack serving though, I like to measure 2 tablespoons of chia seeds for every half cup of milk. You can play around with the measurements to find the consistency you like best.</p>
             <p>Finally, close the mason jars, place it in the fridge for at least 2 hours or up to 7 days. The chia seeds will absorb all the milk and sweetener and be ready to eat then</p></div>

            <p>Not bad right? And the beauty of it is that you can store them in the fridge for a whole week, and grab one when you’re hungry. I like topping mine with fresh fruit or dried fruit, nuts, shredded coconut, hemp seeds, granola and so many more toppings. It makes such a great option for meal prepping too, because meal prepping includes planning for those in-between meals.</p>
